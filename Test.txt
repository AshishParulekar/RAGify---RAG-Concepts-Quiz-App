{"Question No":"0", "Question ":"What does Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) primarily combine?", "User Answer":"A- Rule-based systems and neural networks", "Result":"Incorrect", "Correct Answer":"Retrieval-based methods and generative models (neural networks)" }|,
{"Question No":"1", "Question ":"In RAG, embeddings are used to convert text into numerical vectors for efficient similarity search.", "User Answer":"True", "Result":"Correct", "Correct Answer":"True"}|,
{"Question No":"2", "Question ":"Explain the role of a retriever component in a RAG system.", "User Answer":"", "Result":"Incorrect", "Correct Answer":"The retriever searches and retrieves relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base to provide contextual information for the generator."}|,
{"Question No":"3", "Question ":"Which of the following is a commonly used vector database for storing embeddings in RAG architectures?", "User Answer":"A- PostgreSQL", "Result":"Incorrect", "Correct Answer":"Vector databases like FAISS, Pinecone, or Milvus"}|,
{"Question No":"4", "Question ":"Hybrid search in RAG combines both keyword-based search and vector similarity search to improve retrieval accuracy.", "User Answer":"True", "Result":"Correct", "Correct Answer":"True"}|,
{"Question No":"5", "Question ":"Describe how prompt engineering can influence the performance of the generator in a RAG pipeline.", "User Answer":"cvbgc", "Result":"Incorrect", "Correct Answer":"Prompt engineering guides the generator by crafting effective prompts that improve response relevance, coherence, and informativeness."}|,
{"Question No":"6", "Question ":"Which evaluation metric is most suitable for measuring the relevance of retrieved documents in a RAG system?", "User Answer":"A- BLEU score", "Result":"Incorrect", "Correct Answer":"Metrics like Recall@k or Precision@k are more suitable for retrieval evaluation; BLEU is for generation quality."}|,
{"Question No":"7", "Question ":"The generator in RAG directly uses raw text data to produce responses without relying on retrieved documents.", "User Answer":"True", "Result":"Incorrect", "Correct Answer":"False; the generator relies on retrieved documents as context to produce responses."}|,
{"Question No":"8", "Question ":"What is the purpose of embeddings in the context of RAG, and why are they important?", "User Answer":"vb vc", "Result":"Incorrect", "Correct Answer":"Embeddings convert text into dense numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning, enabling efficient similarity search for retrieval."}|,
{"Question No":"9", "Question ":"In the RAG architecture, which component is responsible for generating natural language answers?", "User Answer":"A- Retriever", "Result":"Incorrect", "Correct Answer":"Generator"}
